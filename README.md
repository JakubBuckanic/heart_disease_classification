# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques. We conducted a comprehensive analysis, starting from problem definition and data preparation, including handling missing values and outliers. This was followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships.

## Project Structure
- **/data**: Contains all datasets used in the analysis.
- **/reports**: Contains all figures generated during the analysis.
- **/models**: Contains all models created during the project.

## Methodology
1. **Problem Definition and Data Preparation**:
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed feature distributions and relationships.
3. **Model Building and Comparison**:
   - Built and compared three machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression.
   - Used scaling and hyperparameter tuning (manual, RandomizedSearchCV, and GridSearchCV) to optimize performance.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated models based on metrics such as ROC curve, AUC score, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
   - Identified the Random Forest Classifier as the best model.
5. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Conducted analysis to understand which factors were most influential in predicting heart disease.

## Results
The Random Forest Classifier was identified as the best model based on our evaluation metrics. The feature importance analysis provided valuable insights into the key indicators of heart disease.

## Conclusion
This systematic approach allowed us to develop a robust predictive model and gain valuable insights into the key indicators of heart disease.
